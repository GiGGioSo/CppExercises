# CppExercises
10 beginner exercises I used to learn the basics of C++ and make.

I got these exercises from here: https://www.cplusplus.com/forum/articles/12974/ 
These tasks go from very easy at the start to surprisingly challenging at the end (at least for a beginner).


I had a lot of fun doing them, exspecially 6Dungeon and 9Bunnies, and I recommend them to anyone starting C++.
